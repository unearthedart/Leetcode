    "When creating or altering a table in SQL, several types of **constraints** can be defined to enforce rules on the data. Here is a list of common SQL constraints that can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **PRIMARY KEY**\n",
    "   - Ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier.\n",
    "   - A table can only have **one** `PRIMARY KEY`, but it may consist of one or more columns (composite key).\n",
    "   - Automatically creates a **UNIQUE** constraint and **NOT NULL** constraint on the primary key column(s).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **FOREIGN KEY**\n",
    "   - Defines a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table to the `PRIMARY KEY` or a `UNIQUE` column in another table.\n",
    "   - Ensures referential integrity by restricting values that do not exist in the referenced table.\n",
    "   - The foreign key column(s) can have the `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` actions for how the database should handle deletions or updates to the referenced rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       customer_id INT,\n",
    "       FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **UNIQUE**\n",
    "   - Ensures that all values in a column (or a group of columns) are distinct (i.e., no duplicates).\n",
    "   - Unlike `PRIMARY KEY`, a table can have **multiple** `UNIQUE` constraints.\n",
    "   - `NULL` values can be allowed in `UNIQUE` columns unless specifically restricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **NOT NULL**\n",
    "   - Ensures that a column cannot have `NULL` values.\n",
    "   - This constraint guarantees that the column will always contain a valid, non-blank value.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **CHECK**\n",
    "   - Ensures that values in a column meet a specific condition or logical expression.\n",
    "   - This is used to enforce domain integrity by restricting values based on a condition (e.g., a range, pattern, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       age INT CHECK (age >= 18)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **DEFAULT**\n",
    "   - Provides a default value for a column if no value is provided during row insertion.\n",
    "   - Useful when you want to ensure a column gets a predefined value unless explicitly overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **INDEX**\n",
    "   - Although not technically a constraint, an `INDEX` is often used to improve performance on columns frequently searched or used in joins.\n",
    "   - It is not a constraint, but it is commonly used alongside constraints for performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON employees(emp_name);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **AUTOINCREMENT (or SERIAL)**\n",
    "   - Automatically generates a unique value for a column, typically used with `PRIMARY KEY` columns. \n",
    "   - **AutoIncrement** is used in systems like MySQL, while `SERIAL` is used in PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (MySQL):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50)\n",

    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **CONSTRAINT**\n",
    "   - The `CONSTRAINT` keyword allows for naming a constraint when defining it. This can be used with `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`, etc.\n",
    "   - Named constraints can help with better error handling and easier reference when altering or dropping constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT,\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       CONSTRAINT pk_emp_id PRIMARY KEY (emp_id)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **DEFERRABLE / INITIALLY IMMEDIATE / INITIALLY DEFERRED**\n",
    "   - These are used in conjunction with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints to specify when the foreign key constraint should be checked.\n",
    "   - `INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`: Foreign key constraint is enforced immediately after each statement.\n",
    "   - `INITIALLY DEFERRED`: Foreign key constraint is enforced at the end of the transaction, not after each statement.\n",
    "   - **DEFERRABLE** allows the foreign key enforcement to be deferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       customer_id INT,\n",
    "       CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)\n",
    "       REFERENCES customers (customer_id)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Additional or Advanced Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **EXCLUSION CONSTRAINT (PostgreSQL-specific)**\n",
    "   - **PostgreSQL** supports exclusion constraints, which ensure that no two rows in a table satisfy the same condition based on a set of columns.\n",
    "   - This is different from `UNIQUE` as it allows complex conditions and operators for exclusion.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example (PostgreSQL):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE events (\n",

    "       EXCLUDE USING gist (room_id WITH =, event_period WITH &&)\n",

    "   This ensures that no two events overlap in the same room.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **CHECK CONSTRAINT with a COMPOSITE CONDITION**\n",
    "   - You can also use `CHECK` constraints to enforce complex conditions based on multiple columns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **CASCADING OPTIONS (for Foreign Keys)**\n",
    "   - When defining `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, you can specify actions that should be taken when a record in the referenced table is updated or deleted. These actions can be:\n",
    "     - **ON DELETE CASCADE**: Automatically deletes the rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted.\n",
    "     - **ON DELETE SET NULL**: Sets the foreign key column in the child table to `NULL` when the referenced row is deleted.\n",
    "     - **ON DELETE SET DEFAULT**: Sets the foreign key column in the child table to its default value when the referenced row is deleted.\n",
    "     - **ON UPDATE CASCADE**: Automatically updates the foreign key in the child table when the referenced row in the parent table is updated.\n",
    "     - **ON UPDATE SET NULL**: Sets the foreign key in the child table to `NULL` when the referenced row is updated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       customer_id INT,\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **COLLATE (used for string comparison)**\n",
    "   - The `COLLATE` clause specifies the collation (ordering) for string comparison. This can be used when creating or altering tables to define the sorting order or case sensitivity.\n",
    "   - This is important when working with databases that support multiple languages and case sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       emp_name VARCHAR(50) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN\n",
    "   );\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **USER-DEFINED CONSTRAINTS**\n",
    "   - Some DBMSs allow for user-defined constraints or triggers that can implement custom validation rules beyond the standard constraints. These are typically implemented through stored procedures or triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (PostgreSQL):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",

    "   FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_salary();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **NO ACTION (Foreign Key)**\n",
    "   - A `NO ACTION` constraint is similar to `RESTRICT`, but the difference lies in when the check is enforced.\n",
    "   - If an attempt is made to delete or update a row that is referenced by a foreign key, it may raise an error or restrict the action based on the DBMS's behavior.\n",

    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       customer_id INT,\n",

    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **FULLTEXT (Full-text search constraints, MySQL and PostgreSQL)**\n",
    "   - Some databases allow full-text indexing, which can be treated as a constraint. This ensures that columns containing text are optimized for search, and can enforce certain rules related to how text search is performed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example (MySQL):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE articles (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       title VARCHAR(255),\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **ENUM (Data type constraint, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)**\n",
    "   - Some databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL allow you to define `ENUM` types, which restrict the column values to a predefined set of values. This is not technically a constraint but works similarly by enforcing a limited set of accepted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (MySQL):\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "       product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "Here’s a breakdown of the date formats you might encounter in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **ISO 8601 Date Format (Most Common)**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Unix Timestamps**: Some systems allow you to store or query timestamps as Unix time (number of seconds since January 1, 1970). For example:\n",
    "  - MySQL: `FROM_UNIXTIME(1609459200)` would convert the Unix timestamp `1609459200` to a readable date.\n",

    "  - **PostgreSQL**: `DATE '2024-11-25'`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date with Time Zone**: In databases like PostgreSQL, you can include time zone information with `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`:\n",
    "  - `'2024-11-25 14:30:00+02'` (UTC+2 time zone)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Common Errors to Avoid**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using incomplete date formats like `'2021 Dec'` is not allowed.\n",
    "- Avoid using ambiguous formats (e.g., `'12/11/2024'`), because some systems interpret this as MM/DD/YYYY and others as DD/MM/YYYY.\n",
    "- Make sure to use single quotes around date strings (`'YYYY-MM-DD'`).\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use **ISO 8601** format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for dates, as it is the most widely accepted format across SQL databases.\n",

    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Grouping**:\n",
    "   - `GROUP BY Region` groups rows by region (`North` and `South`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - `SUM(Sales)` calculates the total sales for each group:\n",
    "     - North: 100 + 150 + 200 = 450  \n",
    "     - South: 200 + 50 = 250  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering**:\n",
    "   - `HAVING SUM(Sales) > 300` filters out groups where total sales are 300 or less.\n",
    "   - Only `North` remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `HAVING` Without `GROUP BY`**\n",
    "Even without `GROUP BY`, you can use `HAVING` with aggregate functions to filter overall results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Rows\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query filters the entire dataset, returning results only if there are more than 4 rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Combining `WHERE` and `HAVING`**\n",
    "You can use both `WHERE` and `HAVING` in the same query. `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, while `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Find regions with total sales greater than 300, but only include products with sales above 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "WHERE Sales > 100\n",
    "GROUP BY Region\n",
    "HAVING SUM(Sales) > 300;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "1. `WHERE Sales > 100`: Filters out rows with sales ≤ 100:\n",
    "   - Remaining rows:  \n",
    "     | Region  | Product | Sales |  \n",
    "     |---------|---------|-------|  \n",

    "     | South   | B       | 200   |  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `GROUP BY Region`: Groups rows by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `SUM(Sales)`: Calculates total sales for each region:\n",
    "   - North: 150 = 150  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. `HAVING SUM(Sales) > 300`: Filters out regions with total sales ≤ 300:\n",

    "### **Summary of CROSS JOIN**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CROSS JOIN** combines every row from one table with every row from another table.\n",
    "- The result is the **Cartesian product**, where the number of rows in the result equals the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table.\n",
    "- **No ON condition** is required, and it’s typically used to generate combinations or compare every row from one table with a set of values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Although **CROSS JOIN** can be useful in some cases, it can also generate very large result sets, especially when both tables contain a large number of rows. Use it carefully, especially in production environments."

    "The `UNION` operator in SQL is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set, **stacking** the rows from one query on top of the rows from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Tables Must Have the Same Number of Columns:**\n",
    "   - Both tables involved in the `UNION` must have the same number of columns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Column Data Types Must Match:**\n",
    "   - The columns in both tables must have compatible data types in the same order. For example, if the first column in both tables is a `string` (like `pokemon`), the second column (like `type`) should also have the same data type across both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Duplicate Rows:**\n",
    "   - By default, `UNION` removes any duplicate rows. If you want to include duplicates, you would use `UNION ALL` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**table1 (pokemon):**\n",
    "\n",

    "| Charmander | Fire   |\n",
    "| Squirtle   | Water  |\n",
    "| Snorlax    | Normal |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "- The `UNION` operator combines the rows from both `table1` and `table2`, stacking them on top of each other.\n",
    "- It removes any duplicate rows, but in this example, there are no duplicates, so all rows from both tables appear in the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `UNION ALL` Example:\n",
    "If you want to keep duplicates, you can use `UNION ALL`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "UNION ALL\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM table2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would result in:\n",

    "| pokemon    | type   |\n",
    "|------------|--------|\n",
    "| Bulbasaur  | Grass  |\n",
    "| Charmander | Fire   |\n",
    "| Squirtle   | Water  |\n",
    "| Snorlax    | Normal |\n",

    "Yes, in SQL, the equivalent of an **intersection** (where you get the common rows between two queries) is done using the `INTERSECT` operator. It works similarly to `UNION`, but instead of combining all rows, it returns only the **rows that appear in both result sets**.\n",
